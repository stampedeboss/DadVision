### Description   ###
#####################
# This script is intended for people using XBMC library function.
# There are two modes to this script to assist you in organizing your library.
# 	1)  Checks all files located in specified location.  Then returns message
#	    if this file does not exist in database.
#	2)  Checks each record in the database then looks to see if the file exists.
#
# Output could come in the following forms:
#	1) ORPHANFS ENTRY FOUND: /home/soukenka/tvshows/CSI/Season 10/CSI.S10E02.720p.HDTV.X264-DIMENSION.mkv
#	This means that there was a file located in the filesystem that was not found in the database.  This could
#	be resolved by a simple update library.  However if the file is still displayed in output with an up to date
#	library then you need to resolve whatever naming issue you are experiencing.  Many articles exists to assist
#	you in getting this into your library for example: http://wiki.xbmc.org/?title=TV_Shows
#
#	2) ORPHANDB ENTRY FOUND: /home/soukenka/downloads/torrents/tvshows/Medium/Season 4/Medium_S04E01.avi
#	This means that you probly deleted the file however it still exists in the library.  Running a clean library
#	from the settings menu usually resolves this.
#
#	3) RAR ENTRY FOUND: /home/soukenka/movies/Open.Graves.2009.DVDRip.XViD-ReenCoTRiN/rar://%2fhome%2fasoukenka%2fmovies%2fOpen%2eGraves%2e2009%2eDVDRip%2eXViD%2dReenCoTRiN%2freencitrin%2dgravecitrin%2erar/reencitrin-gravecitrin.avi
#	Was not sure how to put this problem exists that because it is a rar file there are usually several parts which cause
#	this script to have orphans.  I usually just confirm movie is in library then add it to ignore list.
#
#	4) STACKEDDB ENTRY FOUND: /home/soukenka/movies/The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (2002)/stack:///home/soukenka/movies/The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (2002)/The.Lord.Of.The.Rings.The.Two.Towers.Extended.Edition.720p.HDTV.DTS.x264-THOR.disc1.mkv , /home/soukenka/movies/The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (2002)/The.Lord.Of.The.Rings.The.Two.Towers.Extended.Edition.720p.HDTV.DTS.x264-THOR.disc2.mkv
#	Sometimes 2 files are stacked in the database so output is put here usually not a big deal
